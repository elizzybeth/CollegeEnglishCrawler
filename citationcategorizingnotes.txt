/* CITATION CATEGORIZING

use Express to put this stuff in
	load the database
	listen for connections
		node becomes a webserver by listening for connections
	if you connect to that port with a web browser, it'll send from your web browser to node.js

separate HTML file that has a template
	request stuff from mongo
	use underscore
		read file
		pass to underscore: make template function
		gives back a function that returns actual HTML
	on the page, have to be able to change all the things to be what I want, click "save"
	save will have to read input: post listener
		have ID for an article
		save new values for each variable: type and number of citations
		inside listener, parse through things, do mongo updates

SPEC
webapp that would bring up one record at a time, citation highlighted in context
    guesses a classification if possible, displays guess
    next [n], back [b], citation[c], not a citation [x]
        if select [c], auto selects [1], if correct [n] 
            press [2] to switch to citation string
        confirm guess with [n] or type
            [1] single citation
                page /d+                
                author [A-Za-z]+ 
                    with page [A-Za-z]+/s/d+
                brief title ".[^"]*"
                    with page ".[^"]*"/s/d+
                    with author ".[^"]*"/s[A-Za-z] (look up exclusion)
                    with author/page ".[^"]*"/s[A-Za-z]/s/d+
                    with author ".[^"]*"/s/w
            [2] citation string
                guesses how many there are
                highlighted number, automatically overwrites if you start typing
                when you hit next key, saves it
            no automatic classification
				    
running count of records categorized, records left to categorize

POA
citationCategorizer.html:
    




		    
    keymap button for fwd, button for back
    button for make a change
        change 
manually categorize all the stuff in parens
most stuff it auto guesses, and I y/n whether it's correct
    most things with just a number are page # citation
    most things with word and number are author page # citation
    most things with word number ; word number are author/page ; author/page
        etc.
        
once in a while, I have to make an edit or put in more info, maybe

// Go through articleText looking for stuff in parens
	// remember only to go through articles that aren't marked as disabled
	
// If find something in parens, save it as a possible citation
    // Show it to me for possible categorizing with 1 sentence(?) before/after for context
	// limiters? less than X words?
	// if (\d+), type: pageNumber
	    // confirm y/n
	// if (\w\s\d+), type: authorPageNumber
	    // confirm y/n
	// if ([\w*\s*\d*] \; [\w*\s*\d*]), need to make something similar for 2 - 8? 9? chained citations
		\(([.*] \; [.*])*\)
// Output:
	full sentence (for context)
	article URL
// Input:
	citation? y/n
	type:
